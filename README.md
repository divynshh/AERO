# AERO

To deal with the medical concept of bed blocking in simpler terms the inability to accommodate needy patients in times of acute emergency or outbreak. To reduce the time in the hour of critical need and to begin the treatment as early as possible, this online platform will get the patients the real time updates on the number of beds and blood units available at the hospital.

‘AERO’, which stands for APPLICATION for EMERGENCY RESPONSE OPERATION, will be a web-based platform along with a mobile application that will use a software installed in registered hospitals to display the availability of beds and blood units.
